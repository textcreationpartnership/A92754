            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>ANY will wonder, what feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings I have to bee detain'd in a place ſo unſuitable to my Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whileſt few vouchſafe mee their Commiſeration, all deem me worthy of reproofe. Truly I do acquieſce in this to mee harſh tenour of Engliſh Juſtice, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey it without reſiſtance, to this univerſall and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved hatred towards me and ours. Notwithſtanding becauſe I am conſcious of my owne intentions herein, I cannot but grieve to ſee the whole envy and malice of this affair purſue only my part, not having given (neither the firſt nor the 2. time) any occaſion for it, without per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting that we remote ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our native country injoy any pity at all. Much I am afflicted that few cheriſh my cauſe, moſt withſtand it, and as it were none inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelves to aſcribe this unhappy accident (as really it ought) to chance, rather than to malice, to the ignorance of ſome particulars, than to the pertinacy of all, to the reciprocall hurly-burly, than to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:118593:3"/>violence of one onely ſide. This I onely ſay, to that end that I may lay open the buſineſs, and intentions herein ſo to bee made apparent to the moſt beloved Gentry and People of England, that all may more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily compaſſionate my Perſon and condition, and reſtore to mee and ours againe their love and favour, which truly in theſe circumſtances I equally value with my life.</p>
            <p>It no wiſe can bee conceived how deeply I am ſtruck, when I reflect that I am come to that point, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I in my proper Cauſe, nor others can bee heard for mee, many imagining their aime and honour to withſtand me as much as is poſſible; yea, and that thoſe who aſſiſt mee heerein therefore are dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med principals in the act. Whence to you all who read theſe I leave it to bee judged, what an unſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble griefe I muſt needs inwardly feele, when I heare ſuch ſtrange ſpeeches againſt me every where in this City, and that only for my ſake my Countrey men all and Nation diſpleaſe them. Truly if it were as at firſt it is now bruited, I might juſtly ſeeme a madman to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards my Brother, moſt uncivil to all the Engliſh Gentry, and ingratefull to all this City wherein I have ſo long been &amp; ſo well known: But theſe fore-running diſcourſes at firſt diſcredit themſelves by their variety, and afterwards totally become groundleſſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Should I, as it is ſaid, oppreſſe the Engliſh, or withſtand them from whom my Brother ſent hither particularly by my King demands peace and amity, and under whoſe protection wee all are? ſhould I commit by ſuch a levity everlaſting by mee to bee repented, that I ſhould not alſo ſeem to intend what my Brother
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:118593:3"/>with ſo much paines hitherto endeavoured to effect? I would not have been ſo great an enemy to my ſelfe, both in the opinion of my Brother, and in the eſteeme of my King, in whoſe hands it lies to diſpoſe of my whole life, honour, and fortune; which ſince it is ſo, I confide none will exaggerate my Cauſe, or accuſe mee beyond Reaſon.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Should I hate the Engliſh Gentry? alas, I am a Gentleman my ſelf, and indeed I much ever deſired to deſerve their love &amp; eſteem: I never would have dream'd ſuch a folly, unleſſe I had firſt forgot my owne birth, in which ſo far I am from doing wrong, that I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to ſhew my ſelfe, as I was able, a true follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of my Brother, whom I ſtill perceived and noted heartily deſirous to oblige all Gentlemen, by whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver manner of civility and kindneſſe hee could afford them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Should I laſtly on ſet purpoſe bring, I know not what Armes to beſiege the Exchange? I witneſſe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and beg pardon firſt of all this Common-wealth, to which I totally ſubmit my ſelfe, then againe of my deare Brother, if either of them harbour ſuch an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my deportments: nay, if by chance I had indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly offended in this kinde, it might have been aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to my unexperienced youth and pardonable, but every indifferent Judge will finde mee to have onely ſought to defend my ſelfe and honour, and not in the leaſt to offend others. And I ſweare to Heaven, I knew nothing of what is ſpoke of powder which was found in a Hackney Coach.</p>
            <p>Some will object, why would I goe and meet the threats I might have before heard of? firſt, I believ'd
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:118593:4"/>no ſuch threats, which I conjectured could not proceed but from a very few, eſpecially when I reflected of the great civilities and kindneſſes which for this yeare and more had been betwixt the Engliſh and Portugall Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and that all differences might be decided by ſome other handſom mean &amp; not by the like threats. Again, how could I imagine any hindrance to go to ſo publick a place, which I ſee open to all Nations, even to the baſeſt ſort of people? if I had been forbidden any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate houſe, by its owner, or by a Decree of Parliament from any publick place, I had kept home and not ſtirr'd, to manifeſt with joy and promptneſſe my obedience therin to this Common-wealth. And thus I fear'd none, nor ſuſpected in the leaſt, that any would aſſault mee when they ſaw mee unarm'd, neither did I thinke that a publick place could defend me, when my Brothers houſe is patent to all. Notwithſtanding being danger of life and honour muſt bee provided againſt, I would not go totally unprepared, in caſe any where I ſhould be offended.</p>
            <p>Comming therefore to the Exchange as I was wont to doe, on the 21. of <hi>November</hi> 1653. ſo to gaine and increaſe love and acquaintance with the Engliſh Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, I walked with a certaine Engliſh man new ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from Portugall, who aſſured mee of the civilities he injoyed among my Country-men there: As we two thus hand in hand diſcourſed, behold, on a ſudden, an Engliſh Gentleman obtrudes himſelfe betwixt us with great violence: I regarded not this untill I heard that party &amp; my companion at variance. At this though I underſtood little, yet I very much reſented it, becauſe I carneſtly wiſhed nothing of ſcandall attempted where
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:118593:4"/>I might have any thing to doe This was my minde then, as they will eaſily believe who behold mee with an impartiall eye. But what? out of hand the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman caſteth at me moſt contumelious words, repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them twice or thrice in the French tongue, againſt mee alone who had not offended him, calling mee <hi>Jean Foutre, Brugher,</hi> and <hi>Coquin:</hi> I pray what fleſh alive in theſe conjunctures could have contain'd himſelfe from taking a juſt revenge? Let any ſpeake whether he could have patiently took the like injurious words from me: if not, why ſhould it be my charge and only blame, not to have been then ſo patient as to hold my hands without repelling him, making at mee in ſo ſcurvy a manner? Tis true, I then ruſhed upon him, yet naked as I was without either ſword, or any weapon that could doe him the harme hee in that mutiny received. Here quickly a world of Engliſh crouded about me, by whom I was unkindly, yea harſhly abuſed, and by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſwords drawne againſt my life, compelled to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw my ſelfe thence as I could, eſpecially perceiving none there ſo favourable as would either ſpeak or ſtand in my behalfe.</p>
            <p>Upon this I was no little afflicted, and tenderly felt what was acted againſt mee a Gentleman, a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and innocent, if I had beene rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, againſt whom none in my owne Countrey durſt have attempted ſo much, if not for the honour of my deportment, at leaſt for the reſpect and duty of my Birth. I ſay no more but leave it to your commiſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to reflect how deeply I reſented this. I know you are well inſtructed all in thoſe wholſome Counſels of holy Writ, and therefore with greater confidence I now
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:118593:5"/>and ever did caſt my ſelfe into your armes fearing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, Levit, 19. v. 33. <hi>And if a ſtranger ſojourn with thee in your Land, ye ſhall not vex him.</hi> Exod. 22. v. 21. <hi>Thou ſhalt neither vex a ſtranger nor oppreſſe him, for ye were ſtrangers in the land of Egypt.</hi> Exod. 23. v. 9. <hi>Alſo thou ſhalt not oppreſs a ſtranger, for ye know the heart of a ſtranger, ſeeing ye were ſtrangers in the Land of Egypt.</hi> I am ſorry that the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman cauſe of all this ſhould have been wounded, and if any of my followers did it, I am the more ſorry, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though 'twere done in my defence. But I call God to witneſſe I had not ſo much as a pin in my hand then by which I could in the leaſt harme him.</p>
            <p>With theſe unhandſome injuries I thought to have reſted, hoping the party that had affronted me would have been ſenſible of what he had done, and ſo I would have deem'd my ſelfe ſufficiently ſatisfied. But what? There were ſeveral who abuſed divers Portugal Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men then caſually walking, with blows and words. Nay, the Gentleman of whoſe wound was complained ſo much, aſſiſted by many others meeting a Portugal Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman ignorant of what had paſſed, ruſhed upon him, &amp; with a blow in the face, wanted but a little to put out one of his eyes.</p>
            <p>I was an am ſure all this did proceed but from ſome few ill affected perſons, and therefore the day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, I eſteemed it ſuperfluous to looke to my ſelfe more than uſually.</p>
            <p>I ſlighted thoſe who then publickly bragged that no Portugals ſhould dare to returne and expatiate there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: for I ſhould much have admir'd, if from the plurality of this Nation ſo deare to us all ſuch hard ſpeeches and prohibitions had proceeded, eſpecially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:118593:5"/>how all Engliſh, and particularly Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, are, and have alwayes been lov'd and honour'd in my Countrey, where Portugal againſt Portugal would have boldly and laudably ſtood for any ſtranger in ſuch a rancounter, according to that <hi>Polyanthea, Verbo hoſpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litatis redeo: Do no harme nor affront a Gueſt and ſtranger, do not ſo much as indanger his ſafety,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe conſiderations I came the next night to the Exchange, but with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> farre other intent then I am accuſed of; I my ſelfe brought no arms at all, nor any of thoſe that then entred with mee, ſo great was my confidence in the affection I hoped from the greateſt part of whomſoever I ſhould finde there ſought for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way &amp; deſerved by my Brother and my ſelfe. This I did on purpoſe perſwading my ſelfe with ſweet and civill language, and with my unarmed habit of both minde and body, to appeaſe and moderate thoſe that by chance might be there unſatisfied by reaſon of the miſtake hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening the night before. I call God to witneſſe who ſearcheth the ſecrets of hearts, and I appeale alſo to all the Engliſh Gentlemen, there to argue me, if hitherto I flinch from the truth.</p>
            <p>For my ſelfe I ſtood not at all in awe of thoſe threats which I was informed of, but ſome of our domeſticks followed me of their owne accord, apprehending ſome danger in my behalfe, ſo to aſſiſt mee if need were, but only in a defenſive way, whereſoever it were requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite. 'Tis true, all are prone to love and reſpect me, to whom I will not give any thankes upon this occaſion, but only reſent and grieve that they ſhould follow mee in ſo great a number, whoſe duty I aſſure them ſhall
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:118593:6"/>be leſſe acceptable, becauſe it was not expected; for I do proteſt I dream'd not of half ſo many as that night came after me. Although amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g theſe ſom had too many arms, as I ſaid before, yet would not attempt any thing, if I ſhould injoy quietly the liberty of my accuſtomed walk. I confide nothing can bee laid to their charge as done otherwiſe then I relate; yet if any thing were unto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly and fooliſhly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted by any one of them, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech it may not be or ſeeme my fault, who was ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ignorant of it; and I would rigorouſly puniſh them, if my Brother but granted mee leave; nay, I would importune his Excellency, and my King alſo with bowed knees for ſuch a power, ſo exceſſive is my ſorrow for this moſt unhappy accident, in which I heare we have diſpleas'd ſo many of this City, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly of the Exchange-Merchants, who have aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted many things wholly unknowne to mee againſt mee and ours.</p>
            <p>It is hard to take away the firſt impreſſions ſo deeply grounded, yet I humbly beg of them all, that without any partiall love or averſion each one would ſay no more then his conſcience dictates, and hee aſſuredly knows. I doubt not this I demand, for none can but pity us, ſeeing we are ſo ſmall a company, ſo remote from our Countrey, and to that condition brought, that moſt are prone to cenſure and condemne us by the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry name of Portugals, eſpecially becauſe the totall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy of all this buſineſſe by moſt is onely aſcribed to us. Let none I pray be ſo much our enemy as to exaggerate our crime above truth, but let all favour us for our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer affection, rather than hate us for this preſent event.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:118593:6"/>For you, Noble Engliſh Gentlemen, Pardon mee, if I were ſo touched with too quick a ſpurre of Honour, that nothing could retard me from comming to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, yet by me unexpected broyle. I never imagined what ſo unluckily fell out, but put a greater confidence in the civill Character I framed of each one (nor was I deceived in moſt) of a more kind and gallant diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then to give an origine or provocation to all this which preſſeth me alone. You know and experience, how ardent the thought of glory is in generous ſoules, whence I grant that I do not contemne my life, but I far more value my honour: although I proteſt if I could have foreſeen what befell, for all thoſe threats I had not come to the Exchange, but would have waved my ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour a little blemiſhed by the indiſcreet Counſels and threats of ſome few: I would not, I ſay, have ventured ſo before I had made my way by my civility to you all, and procured a better underſtanding reciprocally 'twixt both parties. But believe me I did not think it my duty either to fear or flie, or to be reconciled to any that juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly would meet me there upon any unhandſome tearms, for indeed I was conſcious that I had peradventure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, but given no offence to any that would a right reflect and underſtand me.</p>
            <p>Let here that Engliſh Gentleman ſpeake, if he will honour and befriend mee ſo far in theſe my ſtraights, for he muſt needs call to minde how I then carried my ſelfe: He firſt expoſtulated quietly with mee for what befel the night before, to whom I repli'd in all meekneſs &amp; civility, that I was ready if need were to ſatisfie both him and all the Engliſh Gentry, as was fit for me to do
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:118593:7"/>and them to demand. This alſo I added and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that none ſhould ſo miſtake mee as to eſteeme it any injury, contempt, or quarrell to them at all: for indeed the Portugall Gentry can neither preſume, nor wiſh to conteſt with the Engliſh, from whom they ſeek and deſire a firme and ſtable peace and union.</p>
            <p>While thus things were carried, behold, all the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change men with great noiſe ſhut up their ſhops, which I will not interpret to any ill intention againſt my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for both I in French as I could, and divers En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Gentlemen cried out aloud, what's the buſineſſe? what needs all this? to what purpoſe ſo great a change? Nevertheleſſe no Portugall did hitherto endeavour any hoſtility at all, untill ſuch time as a Piſtol was diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon the very aſcent of the lower walke to the higher; heer began the unhappy mutiny wherin ſo much ill follow'd, which I grieve as much as any Engliſh man whatever. Unhappy man! whoſe ſhot that was, a moſt raſh action and cauſe of all this, whether Engliſh or Portugall, if taken he deſerves no light puniſhment. I am ſorry from the bottome of my heart, that my people ſhould ſo love mee, as for the feare they conceiv'd of me to have made way through that throng to ſeek me. I am ſorry, I ſay, becauſe on both parts bloud was ſhed in that confuſion.</p>
            <p>For all this tell mee I pray why that which ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily fell out, ſhould onely produce malice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt mee and ours? is it becauſe that powder was found in a Coach? I doe proteſt before Almighty God, I knew nothing of that; nay, I hope that my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will not leave him unpuniſhed who committed ſo
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:118593:7"/>undiſcreet an action, not onely thereby to give ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to this deſerving Gentry and loving people, but to my ſelfe alſo, ſeeing for that and ſuch other incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate and tumultuous actions I ſuffer theſe no ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry things, and very diſproportionable to my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
            <p>This I write to ſhew my inclinations impartially for Portugals and Engliſh, both whom I deſire to be dear, yea, &amp; to give the trueſt relation I could of all this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, with my intentions therein. I doubt not but my Brother, as the greatneſſe of this affaire required, hath made his addreſſes to the moſt Excellent Counſel, to whoſe prudence and ſafe-guard I commit my ſelfe: nay, I truſt and relie more to the pietie of this Nation to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſtrangers, and people remote from their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, then to this Narration of mine which hath no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther defence for me but naked truth, which I lay before the eyes of all this City, that none have a partiall aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for me and ours, though otherwiſe this buſineſſe hitherto as I heare in Newes Books related, might juſtly deſerve.</p>
            <p>I ask laſtly in all humility of all the Engliſh Gentry, that they will not eſteem any wrong done them by me, ſince even what is effected was not, nor ſhall the like be ever intended by me or ours. Aſcribe I pray you, this whole accident to chance rather than to deliberate envy, and pardon it for the Love our Nation hath ever borne to yours. So I demand mine from you Gentlemen, as my Brother for his King, peace and amity from all your Common-wealth. Unleſſe I were too long, I would compaſſionate many who have ſuffered moſt in this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:118593:8"/>chance, but ſuch perſon or perſons I will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to comfort and ſatisfie when I ſhall be delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from this priſon, as much inferiour to my Native quality, as I hope above my miſdemeanour. In the meane time I lament equally and more this ſad conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture then the humble and abject condition wherein I am, and ſo friendly ſubſcribe my ſelfe,</p>
